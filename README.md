# Insertion Sort

## Description
This program demonstrates the **Insertion Sort algorithm** in C++. It sorts an array in ascending order by taking one element at a time (the `key`) and inserting it into its correct position among the previous elements. The program compares the key with elements before it, shifts larger elements one position ahead, and continues until the entire array is sorted.

## Key Points
- Builds the sorted array one element at a time.
- Compares each element with previous elements to find the correct position.
- Shifts elements greater than the key to make space.
- Efficient for small or nearly sorted arrays.
- Produces a sorted array in ascending order.
